# Breast Cancer Prediction using SVM

This project builds a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as **Benign (B)** or **Malignant (M)**.

## Dataset
Dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Project Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split
- Model building using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation using cross-validation

## Results
- Training Accuracy: ~98%
- Test Accuracy: ~97%

## Visualization
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision-Recall Curve

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Project Goal
To understand the machine learning workflow from preprocessing to model evaluation.
